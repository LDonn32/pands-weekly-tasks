# Weekly Task 02



amount1 =float(input("Enter amount of money in cent:"))

# I tested first line of code and runs ok 

amount2 = float(input("Enter a second amount of money in cents:"))

# now I need to add them together

Sum = (amount1 + amount2)/100

#so far this reads but answer not being shown on terminal

# now i need to print this out so its readable
print("\u20ac35Sum")

# next i need to find out how to include the euro sign without it changing the outcome
